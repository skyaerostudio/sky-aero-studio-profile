# Indonesia Pricing Strategy — SkyAero Studio (2025)
Audience: Ryan (internal), Sales/Proposal  
Goal: Competitive, trustworthy pricing for Indonesia while maintaining quality and margin.

---

## 1) Proposed Tiers (IDR)
> Positioning: AI‑first, investor‑ready prototypes delivered in **2–4 weeks**. Prices reflect Jakarta/Greater Jakarta market expectations for **custom** work, not template sites.

| Tier | Recommended Price (IDR) | Scope Window | Typical Team | Timebox |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| **Simple Prototype** | **Rp 34.9M – 44.9M** | Landing/MVP with auth, CRUD, basic DB, hosted | 1 FE, 0.5 BE, PM | 1–2 weeks |
| **Moderate Build** | **Rp 79.9M – 119.9M** | Full‑stack app + auth + DB + admin + integrations | 1 FE, 1 BE, PM | 2–3 weeks |
| **Full App** | **Rp 199.9M+ (floor)** | Production‑ready app with advanced features, CI/CD, test suite | 2–3 devs, PM | 3–6 weeks |

**Anchoring**: Show crossed international anchor (e.g., USD pricing) with a “Founders’ Launch” tag to signal limited slots each quarter.

---

## 2) Add‑Ons (à la carte)
- **Payments (Stripe/Midtrans)**: + Rp 12–25M  
- **Admin dashboard (Pro)**: + Rp 15–30M  
- **AI features (OpenAI/watsonx integration)**: + Rp 15–40M (plus API usage)  
- **DevOps & monitoring (Vercel + Sentry)**: + Rp 8–18M  
- **Test suite (Playwright + Vitest)**: + Rp 10–22M  
- **Documentation pack (Runbook + API docs)**: + Rp 5–12M  
- **Design polish (brand kit + tokens)**: + Rp 6–15M

> Keep add‑ons brief in the Services page and expand in proposals.

---

## 3) Care Plans (optional, monthly)
- **Basic** (SLA 3 biz days, 10h): **Rp 3.5M**  
- **Growth** (SLA next biz day, 24h): **Rp 7.5M**  
- **Scale** (SLA same day, 60h): **Rp 15M**

---

## 4) Payment Terms & Policies
- **40% deposit to start**, 40% mid‑sprint milestone, 20% at delivery.  
- **Warranty**: 30 days bug‑fix for in‑scope features.  
- **Change Requests**: mini‑estimate with price/time impact; work starts after approval.  
- **Portfolio Rights**: anonymized showcase unless NDA.

---

## 5) Internal Costing Guardrails (for margin)
Assume **effective blended cost** of Rp 250k–500k/hour (junior‑mid devs + overhead).

- **Simple Prototype** (≈ 120–160 hours) → Floor revenue: Rp 30–50M → Maintain ≥ 35% margin.  
- **Moderate Build** (≈ 220–320 hours) → Floor revenue: Rp 70–120M → Maintain ≥ 40% margin.  
- **Full App** (≥ 450 hours) → Floor revenue: Rp 170M+ → Maintain ≥ 45% margin.

> Use this only for internal scoping; quotes to clients stay in the recommended bands.

---

## 6) Packaging Copy (site)
- **Simple Prototype** — “Perfect to validate fast. Auth, CRUD, clean UI, deployed in **≤2 weeks**.”  
- **Moderate Build** — “Investor‑ready app with dashboard, integrations, and handover docs.”  
- **Full App** — “Production‑grade build with test suite, CI/CD, and scaling plan.”

---

## 7) Discounts (limited)
- **Founders’ Launch**: –10~15% for the first 3 clients/quarter (use countdown).  
- **Bundle**: –10% off add‑ons when ordering 2+ (e.g., Admin + Testing).

---

## 8) Proposal Checklist (internal)
- Lock **scope bullets + acceptance criteria**.
- Include **timeline Gantt** and **risk log** (one paragraph).
- Add **payment schedule** and **warranty** on page 1.
- Close with **next steps** and **Calendly link**.

---

## 9) When to Say No (protect brand/margins)
- Budget < Rp 25M but requesting custom web‑app features.  
- “Unlimited revisions” or vague scope without a discovery add‑on.  
- Unwilling to provide content/access needed to hit the 2–4 week timeline.

### Notes
This pricing is calibrated to early‑stage Indonesia tech buyers who value fast time‑to‑market and transparent deliverables. Revisit ranges quarterly.
